# Word Encoding and Decoding Program
This Python program allows you to encode and decode words based on the following rules:

## Encoding Logic:
If the word contains at least 3 characters, remove the first letter and append it at the end.
Next, append three random characters at the beginning and the end of the modified word.
## Decoding Logic:
If the word contains less than 3 characters, simply reverse it.
Otherwise:
Remove three random characters from the start and end of the word.
Remove the last letter and append it to the beginning.
### Usage:
1- Run the program.\
2- Choose whether you want to encode or decode a word.\
3- Enter the word.\
4- The program will perform the specified operation and display the result.
